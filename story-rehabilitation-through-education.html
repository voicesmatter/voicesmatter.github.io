        <h4>BY GAURAV SETT</h4>
        <h5>Published on December 13th, 2018.</h5>
        <p>

          Still in his junior year of high school, Jarrod Wall was facing 60 years to a lifetime in prison. To the people in his community, Wall was known as an honors student, a church volunteer, the president of his class, and a talented track athlete. However, this perception soon proved superficial as his trial revealed a traumatized and troubled young man.
          <br/><br/>
          For years, Wall had been abused by an older acquaintance, compounding into deeper psychological problems as he could not find an opportunity in which he would feel safe to reach out for help. When Wall began to hear rumors that a local man named Eldon Anson was a drug dealer, Wall began to believe that Anson was also an abuser. Eventually lashed out, he ended up robbing and murdering Anson.
          <br/><br/>
          When asked by his attorney to reflect and explain why he committed this crime, Wall was unable to answer. As a teenager unable to cope with his personal struggles, he did not have a greater perspective to understand and interpret his own humanity. Indeed, a psychologist who evaluated Wall during his trial found that Wall was driven to act out by delusional thoughts and mental illness.
          <br/><br/>
          As his promising life took a turn for the worst, Wall was deeply disturbed by his inability to offer a reason for his own actions. This question of resolving his search for meaning became his sole focus, potentially facing a life behind bars.
          <br/><br/>
          Wall claims it took him about ten years to work out his problems through individualized and group therapy. But this environment only offered prisoners a chance to understand the past, trying to prevent relapsing into dangerous behavior. Thrown onto the streets with almost nothing except lost time, many ex-convicts end up in desperate situations often leading to recidivism. Fortunately, Wall’s penitentiary was in an area with a college education program, enabling Wall to create a future.
          <br/><br/>
          Immediately, he earned his GED. Wall also earned an english degree, a psychology degree, and a masters degree in literature. He also worked within prison as a clerk for the university offering these courses, helping others work towards the same goal of self-improvement and empowerment.
          <br/><br/>
          To Wall, education was his “spiritual path to growth.” Through his studies of the liberal arts, he was able to build the foundations of what it means to be a good person. Education offered a chance to develop critical thinking skills and illustrate the human expreincince, enabling empathy and virtue. By creating a strong framework, this education program had created a direct path to rehabilitation and opened up many professional opportunities. This new desire to use his experience in order to help others motivated his decision to become a therapist. Wall studied sixteen hours a day and worked hard until his sentence ended 26 years after being incarcerated.
          <br/><br/>
          Upon release, Wall immediately got his GRE and applied to his alma mater from the prison education program. Despite three prior degrees, Wall’s was rejected with his felon status. But he did not give up, applying to another university and eventually entering their mental health counseling program. Soon, Wall will be able to help others avoid making the mistakes he had, making great use of his education.
          <br/><br/>
          Many years ago, people in Wall’s community believed he was evil and deserving of life in prison. However, the education program transformed this misguided teenager into a motivated and compassionate adult. As Wall’s lawyer stated, this case “taught [him] that good people can do evil things.”
          <br/><br/>
          While Wall waits to become licensed, he has a job installing flooring to cover his school expenses. Although Wall finds dignity in this low-skill work, he claims the career of social work will allow him to take on gives him meaning. As he awaits approval to enter into a professional line of work he believes is his destiny, Wall states that this manual labor “is not the realm that changed my life, nor is it the realm to which I feel like I can help others change theirs.” As long as others can recognize the incredible value of his education, Wall can turn his life around and avoid cycles of incarceration and impoverishment like many other ex-convicts.
