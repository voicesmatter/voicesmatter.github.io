        <h4>BY NOELLE LAMBERT</h4>
        <h5>Published on November 10th, 2018.</h5>

          After John Burnett was kicked out of his New York City apartment without notice, his life began to spiral. He was without his belongings and without a home. For over two years, as Burnett stayed with friends and family, his problems with drugs, alcohol, and depression worsened. Fortunately, he was able to get help from the Bronx Works program and eventually enter into detox to help him with his substance abuse.
          <br/><br/>
          But he still was without a home or job.
          <br/><br/>
          In 2015, Burnett entered into the Urban Pathways program, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing “housing first” to homeless New Yorkers. The program provided him with a free apartment on the Upper West Side, and has helped him springboard back into the life he once had. John now works as a peer specialist at a behavioral health treatment center for adolescents with mental health illnesses and substance abuse. For many like John, they were able to get their independence back.
          <br/><br/>
          That is the ultimate goal of Urban Promise. CEO Frank Shack explains that the “housing first” philosophy is both sustainable and innovative. His methodology for the program is that if people are provided with supportive and stable housing, they can finally find their dignity and reach their “full potential.” Indeed, Shack’s reasoning has fostered a flourishing community in four of New York City’s five boroughs. The non-profit has relocated hundreds of homeless from the streets into new apartments and the subsequent transformations have been remarkable.
          <br/><br/>
          But the success isn’t just domestic.
          <br/><br/>
          Internationally, the movement for public housing is growing. Singapore has implemented this policy on a national scale: 80% of its population lives in government built housing. Aptly seeing rapid urbanization as an urgent matter to anticipate–not be surprised by–the government took charge in the national shift towards public housing units. This shift has paid off economically, socially, and environmentally. In fact, the thousands of buildings that have used sustainability as a pillar for their growth are part of the reason why Singapore is well on track to achieving its city-wide goal to be 80% green by 2030.
          <br/><br/>
          The successes of subsidized homes, both large and small, demonstrate its importance in promoting socio-economic equality and progress. The hope is that, for millions of people like John who struggle to escape a systemic cycle of poverty and lack of equal opportunity, organizations and governments will step up to provide the basic necessities for willing and able citizens to economically mobilize and utilize resources they have been deprived of for too long.
