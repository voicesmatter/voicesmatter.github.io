          Even though non-profits like Urban Promise have demonstrated the tried-and-true principles of housing first policies, government funded housing across the nation that expands this approach is abysmal. Spearheading this sluggish progress is the politically charged debate in America over the merits and feasibility of widely implemented public housing. In New Deal Ruins: Race, Economic Justice and Public Housing Policy, Ed Goetz explains that “quiet successes” in the housing sector are swiftly and constantly “drowned out by loud failures,” like the Cabrini–Green Homes in Chicago. Iterations of failed implementations across the country left countless Americans, across the socio-economic spectrum, tired of not seeing results. But Goetz takes these catastrophes into account, and still concludes that public housing
          <br/><br/>
          But why does this work so well globally? And why hasn’t it worked here? Globally, purposeful public housing policies have been effective for a few reasons.
          <br/><br/>
          First, they flip the daunting ‘problem’ of urbanization on its head. The countries that have had the most success with urban housing are, in fact, the densest. Singapore, for example, decisively built up in cities, and is now one of the highest ranks in city livability. Using urbanization to one’s advantage is key. In Public Housing Assistance, Public Transportation, and the Welfare-to-Work Transition, author Bania attributes the lower income levels in American urban areas not to public housing assistance, but to general neighborhood conditions. Vienna’s success, for example, is largely attributed to the commitment to building communities, not just living complexes. The designs included terraced houses, garden apartment complexes, schools, health centers, shops, and accessible public transportation systems.
          <br/><br/>
          Second, they zoom out to focus on the country’s needs as a whole. Most public housing policies in America only focus on our nation’s poorest, who already receive the smallest amount of the government’s political attention and resources. No wonder projects are so harshly criticized by politicians and disgruntled Americans: they are focused in urban areas that are already facing crime and poverty. Looking at subsidized housing as an issue for city dwellers in general changes both our mindset and the potential for growth. In fact, countries like Austria that have grew view the issue more holistically: author Reinprecht in Social Housing in Europe explains that Austria’s approach acknowledges that “housing is a basic human need that should not be subject to free market mechanisms.” Recognizing that these policies are more than just a trivial item it cross off of a politician’s to-do list is a prerequisite to mirroring this prosperity across the world.
          <br/><br/>
          Unfortunately, America’s attention to public housing doesn’t come close to what is needed. Demand far exceeds the supply, and the available supply of homes in cities like New York are both decrepit and unmaintained. But, the global models of affordable homes imply that a serious rethinking of how we address urbanization and the government’s role is crucial in combating urban poverty and nationwide sustainability.
