          With 2.3 million people currently locked up, the US has the largest prison population and rate of incarceration in the world. The social and economic costs of mass incarceration have gained the attention of a newly bipartisan Congress as the First Step Act enters the legislative docket. By easing mandatory minimums, increasing “earned time credits” that can reduce sentences, and more, the bill aims to reduce thousands of sentences. As suggested by its name, this bill is an incredibly small step forward for a system that needs systemic reform. As lawmakers direct more political capital into criminal justice, investment into prison education programs prove crucial in improving rehabilitation outcomes.
          <br/><br/>
          30% of prisoners do not hold a high school diploma, two times greater than the rate of the general population. Moreover, only 6% hold a postsecondary degree, six times lower than the rate of the general population. People living in disenfranchised communities have diminished educational opportunities, pushing many towards desperate conditions that lead to crime. Fortunately, the education gap between convicts and the general population is fixable.
          <br/><br/>
          Compared to other wealthy nations, American prisons offer few rehabilitation opportunities which is reflected in our incredibly high recidivism rates. One program with program strong record of success is in-prison education. The Vera Institute of Justice reported that only 35 percent of state prisons provide college-level courses, serving only 6 percent of incarcerated individuals nationwide. Room for expansion is immense as the Department of Education finds that nearly 70% of prisoners would like to participate in education programs, 29% of those interested in post-secondary degrees.
          <br/><br/>
          Where they have been implemented, education programs have seen incredible success. In a meta-analysis of 30 years worth of research, researchers from the RAND Corporation find, “inmates who participate in correctional education programs had a 43 percent lower chance of recidivating than those who did not.” The reasoning is simple: Education opens avenues for higher skilled and higher paying jobs that alleviate economic distress that primarily motivates crime. Furthermore, the learning process develops critical thinking skills and allows inmates to find meaning in their passions, reducing their will to harm others.
          <br/><br/>
          One major objection to these programs is the diversion of public funds away from funding education for law-abiding citizens. However, study author Lois Davis argues “Education is a relatively low-cost program you can provide to inmates. But, when you look simply at direct costs, we find that for every dollar invested in a prison education program it will ultimately save taxpayers between $4 and $5 in reincarceration costs... Just to break even, you'd only have to reduce the risk of reincarceration by one to two percentage points. But, the fact that there is a 13-point reduction in risk means you really are achieving substantial cost savings. And this is a conservative estimate of savings because we are not taking into account the indirect costs both to crime victims and the criminal justice system.“
          <br/><br/>
          Prison reform is an area local activists can make the most progress on. Given the proven effectiveness of education programs, it is imperative that these opportunities take the forefront of criminal justice reform movement.
